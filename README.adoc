*A ternary probabilistic programming language for modeling uncertainty*

betlang is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for probabilistic programming built on Racket. Its core primitive is the ternary bet - a choice between three values with associated probabilities. This simple yet powerful concept enables elegant expression of complex probabilistic models.

== Features

=== Core Language
- *Ternary Bets*: `(bet A B C)` - randomly select one of three values
- *Weighted Probabilities*: `(bet/weighted '(A 5) '(B 3) '(C 2))` - non-uniform distributions
- *Conditional Bets*: Make decisions based on predicates
- *Lazy Evaluation*: Only compute the selected branch
- *Composition Operators*: Chain, compose, and combine bets
- *Statistical Utilities*: Probability estimation, entropy, expected values

=== Rich Standard Library

==== Statistics (`lib/statistics.rkt`)
- Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation

==== Probability Distributions (`lib/distributions.rkt`)
- *Discrete*: uniform, Bernoulli, binomial, geometric, Poisson, categorical, multinomial

== Language Philosophy

betlang embraces the ternary principle - fundamental operations involve three choices. This design:

- Models three-way decisions naturally (win/draw/lose, yes/no/maybe)
- Provides richer expressiveness than binary choices
- Creates interesting emergent probabilistic properties
- Inspired by musical ternary form (A-B-A)

== Use Cases

- *Quantitative Finance*: Option pricing, risk analysis, portfolio optimization
- *Statistical Modeling*: Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing
- *Machine Learning*: Probabilistic classification, sampling methods
- *Simulation*: Monte Carlo methods, agent-based modeling
- *Game Theory*: Strategic decision-making, evolutionary dynamics
- *Data Science*: Resampling, bootstrapping, statistical analysis
- *Research*: Probabilistic programming, stochastic processes
